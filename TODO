rethink the initial task
currently : * created on start and not sure it's always ok (is main thread always number 0 ???)
            * ended on RawLogs::new -> only callable from main thread, is it bad ?
            * re-created on reset : reset now only callable from main thread -> is it bad ?

another possible option would be to not have it and create a fake task on the fly.

*****

should we filter out the main thread if he is only waiting ?
