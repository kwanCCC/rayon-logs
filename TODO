- should we filter out the main thread if he is only waiting ?
- don't crash when child in no task
- don't crash if no single root (strengthen graph visualisation)
- deactivate logging in rayon-core
  -> is it ok to duplicate join's code ? :-( i see no other solution
  -> is testing the registry's option fast enough ? should we have a thread local var ?
